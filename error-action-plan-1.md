# Error Action Plan #1 - Progress Update

## Original Issues

1. **Translation Problems**:
   - Mixed language content when switching between Romanian and English
   - Need to standardize all text to be properly translated in Romanian

2. **API Error - Missing Exports**:
   - Error when clicking "Applications": `Export applicationSchema doesn't exist in target module`
   - Module `@/lib/types` not correctly exporting the required schema

3. **Incomplete Features**:
   - Quick action buttons in dashboard not visible
   - Cannot view applications list due to API errors
   - Cannot view application details
   - Cannot create new applications
   - Cannot process applications

## Completed Fixes

1. **Translation System Improvements**:
   - ✅ Added missing translation key `appDescription` to both language files
   - ✅ Added `quickActions` translation key for dashboard
   - ✅ Updated useTranslation hook to include applicationForm translations
   - ✅ Added applicationDetails translations to support the detail view
   - ✅ Fixed hardcoded Romanian text in the dashboard's quick actions section

2. **Type Export Issues**:
   - ✅ Restructured the types directory with separate files for different schemas
   - ✅ Fixed exports in lib/types/index.ts to properly re-export all types
   - ✅ Added applicationSchema directly to application-service.ts for API routes
   - ✅ Updated API routes to use the correct import paths

3. **Basic UI Components**:
   - ✅ Created applications list page at `src/app/[locale]/dashboard/applications/page.tsx`
   - ✅ Created application form component at `src/components/forms/ApplicationForm.tsx`
   - ✅ Created new application page at `src/app/[locale]/dashboard/applications/new/page.tsx`
   - ✅ Created application detail view at `src/app/[locale]/dashboard/applications/[id]/page.tsx`

## Remaining Work

1. **Additional Translation Tasks**:
   - Complete review of all components to ensure proper use of translation hooks
   - Standardize to Romanian as the default language if desired

2. **Applications API Route**:
   - Fix any remaining type issues in the API routes
   - Ensure proper error handling in the API endpoints

3. **UI Implementation**:
   - Complete the form steps with real validation for financial and loan details
   - Add proper error handling for API requests

4. **Application Processing**:
   - Connect the approval/rejection buttons to actual API endpoints
   - Implement the full application evaluation logic

## Next Steps

1. Test the applications page with the fixed exports and new structure
2. Test the detail view for individual applications 
3. Test creating a new application using the form
4. Review any remaining type issues in the codebase

## Testing Results

The fixes implemented so far address the most critical issues:

1. The translations are now more consistent, with explicit hooks for all UI sections
2. The type exports have been restructured to avoid errors
3. Basic UI components have been implemented for all main workflows

Some limitations:
- The application form steps for financial and loan details are simplified
- API endpoints might still have some type mismatches
- The evaluation engine may need further adjustments for the new type structure

These issues can be addressed in further iterations as the application is developed.
